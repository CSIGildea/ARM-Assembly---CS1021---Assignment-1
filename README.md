Student Number - Redacted from PDF.
```

### Where to start...

Please read the specification, then read, "Public - Computing I - Assignment 1 Conor Gildea - gildeaco.pdf",

to aid in understanding, my solution to the given problem and the extra miles I completed for this assignment.

As ARM Assembly is extremely low-level please make sure to make use of the psuedocode I provided in each program.

Note: Psuedocode is completed in near perfect Java.


### To Current TCD CS First Year Students

If you are a current first year TCD CS student reading this, please avoid copying any of this work.

It is much more beneficial to try these assignments yourself, especially for your exams in June.
